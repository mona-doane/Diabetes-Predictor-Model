0-Diabetes Predictor Notebook
This file describes the scope of the project in Jupyter Notebook

1-Methodology
This file contains the step by step methodology used to clean, explore and analyze the data.  Machine learning models are evaluated against the data.  The best fit machine learning model is selected.

2-Application
The machine learning model selected under methodology is used to predict incidence of diabetes given certain factors.  

Due to the size of the data set, a trained model is provided.
