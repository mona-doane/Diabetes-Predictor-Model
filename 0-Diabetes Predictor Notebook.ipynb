    "## PROBLEM DEFINITION:  \n",
    "The problem of diabetes requires early detection and this project aims to create a machine-learning tool that provides First-Class Health Care Systems with a solution.  The question that the machine-learning tool expects to answer is \"Given certain parameters about a person, can one predict whether the person has diabetes?\""
